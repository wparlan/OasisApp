# OasisApp
An iOS Application to incentivize users to drink water daily by taking care of a virtual plant and growing a collection of plants.
I (William Parlan) worked with Greeley Lindberg (glindberg18) to complete this project for CPSC 315: iOS App Development in Fall 2020.
The plant digital assets were created by Greeley Lindberg.
Additionally, we used JTAppleCalendar Cocoa Pod to create the calendar interface for the app.
